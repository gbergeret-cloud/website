As a platform engineer and DevSecOps consultant, my business is simple. I help
my clients build solid foundations, so they can lower cloud costs, reduce
maintenance labour and grow in a sustainable way.

I gained a lot more traction this year, which made me think about how I wanted
my business to evolve.  I'd experienced significant growth before that too – and
much of that progression had come down to my brand, my expertise and the amount
of support my company provides.

To keep things moving forward, I've continued to focus on those three crucial
areas. After another year in business, here’s my biggest learnings so far.

## 1. If you take your brand seriously, customers will take you seriously

When I set out as a solo entrepreneur three years ago, I decided to call my
business GBergeret LTD. If you speak French, you'll get why it's perfect for
what I do: "GBergeret" sounds just like j'hébergerai, which means "I'll host".
I'm a cloud guy, so my business is all about hosting.

But as I won more clients, I realised my brand identity could be easier to
understand. I needed something clearer and more precise, that would make sure I
was seen as a hands-on consultant rather than a traditional contractor.

That's why I decided to change my company name to GBergeret Cloud Services
earlier this year. It wasn't a huge adjustment, I know – but it was an important
one, because it actually reflects what my business does.

## 2. Each client holds valuable lessons for the next one

2023 has been a big year for my company. My retained client list didn't just
double, those existing clients also increased the scope of their projects.
I'm now working with startups across the UK, US and Europe, covering sectors like
payroll, fintech, security, real estate and meal deliveries.

Now that my company has more long-term clients, I've started to see how each
project adds to my knowledge and expertise. Every piece of work generates a
valuable feedback loop, by allowing me to learn new things continuously, which I
can apply with other clients and in other situations.

It's like being a brand consultant who works in both the luxury and budget ends
of the market, constantly switching between high-end problems and cost-effective
solutions. When you’ve seen lots of scenarios play out in real life, you know
what ends up being overcomplicated and time-consuming.

## 3. As your clients grow, your business grows too

Last year I stopped taking on contracting work, so I could focus on clients who
work with me on a regular basis. Over time, many of these retained clients grew,
which I've been really excited to see. I earned their trust at the same time, as
they outsourced more of their infrastructure to me and granted me more deciding
power.

I'm also being commissioned to deliver projects that go beyond my area of
expertise, on the basis that I can expand my team to complement my existing
skills. That's why I decided to make my first hire, for a WinOps engineer who
knows Microsoft-backed cloud inside out.

As I continue to develop what my company offers, I'll be publishing more content
here, on my blog. Next up is a piece on the basics of public cloud, which will
look at the cloud revolution and the benefits of working with an expert. So stay
tuned for more. And if anything in this blog post resonates
