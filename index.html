          <h3>My background
          </h3>
          <p class="text-light-grey">
            Ever since I was little, I’ve always loved building things for
            others. First it was Lego, then it was computers, where I discovered
            assembling something was even more fun than playing with it.
            <br/><br/>
            My career’s also been about building. I got my first SysAdmin job,
            which involved maintaining Linux-based workloads, while on placement
            during my master's at an écoles d'ingénieurs, a prestigious form of
            higher education in France. After my Computer Science degree I moved
            to London, where I got in on the ground floor with DevOps and cloud
            engineering.
            <br/><br/>
            In London I experienced rapid growth first-hand, which taught me what
            it takes to create better platforms faster. That’s why I always keep
            a product mindset, by working to understand your business while
            always keeping sight of the longer-term. I’m hands-on, meticulous and
            passionate about the small details. By getting to know every inch of
            your product, I can adapt my services to your needs.
            <br/><br/>
            I love solving problems. I love seeing companies grow. I love
            supporting businesses and the people who run them, because it’s in my
            DNA. Most of all, I believe that businesses succeed when their
            infrastructures are secure, scalable and easy to maintain. With
            GBergeret Cloud Services, that's exactly what I help my customers
            achieve.

            My clients include both tech and non-tech businesses, but mostly
            startups and SMEs.
            <br/><br/>
            If you’re a tech business, I can support you by integrating myself
            into your existing engineering team. If you don’t have an engineering
            team, I’ll manage your cloud infrastructure by acting as one, for as

          <h3>What I do</h3>
          <p class="text-light-grey">
            All too often, businesses think their cloud infrastructure will run
            itself. But if your cloud provider and developers aren’t giving your
            platform love, then no one is. That’s why you need a platform
            engineer.
            <br/><br/>
            Every company is different, so I tailor my services to each client.
            Depending on what you need help with, we can work together on a
            weekly or monthly basis – but I also provide one-off consulting
            sessions.
            <br/><br/>
            I’ll offer you the same skills and expertise whatever model you
            choose, along with out of hours work and 24/7 emergency support.
