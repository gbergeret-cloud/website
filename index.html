      <h1 class="title">Use the cloud to its full potential</h1>
      <p>
        As a platform engineer and DevSecOps consultant,
        <br/>
        I help small businesses take full advantage of the cloud.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Everything I build is designed to be secure,<br/>
        scalable and easy to maintain.

        <h4>Sustainable</h4>
        <p class="text-s">
          Every business needs solid foundations, so you can keep building on top
        of them.
          <br/><br/>
          That’s why I focus on infrastructure that lasts. If you have a tight
        deadline, we can start with what matters most.

        <h4>Simple</h4>
        <p class="text-s">
          I live by the design principle "keep it simple, stupid!" So I make sure
        everything’s straightforward.
          <br/><br/>
          That means creating modular, cost-effective solutions, which help you
        keep maintenance labour low.

        <p class="text-s">
          I explain technical ideas in simple terms, using examples and analogies.
          <br/><br/>
          I’ll help you understand your infrastructure, so you can own  it
        yourself and appreciate the benefits of the work we do together.

            I’ve been helping startups boost their operational efficiency for as

            <br/>
            For me, it all comes back to the builder mindset. <br/>
            I strive for a complete understanding of my clients’ problems, by
          being a thinker and a doer at the same time.

          </h3>
          <p class="text-light-grey">
            Ever since I was little, I’ve always loved building things for others. First it was Lego, then it was computers, where I discovered assembling something was even more fun than playing with it.
            <br/><br/>
            My career’s also been about building. I got my first SysAdmin job, which involved maintaining Linux-based workloads, while on placement during my master's at an écoles d'ingénieurs, a prestigious form of higher education in France. After my Computer Science degree I moved to London, where I got in on the ground floor with DevOps and cloud engineering.
            <br/><br/>
            In London I experienced rapid growth first-hand, which taught me what it takes to create better platforms faster. That’s why I always keep a product mindset, by working to understand your business while always keeping sight of the longer-term. I’m hands-on, meticulous and passionate about the small details. By getting to know every inch of your product, I can adapt my services to your needs.
            <br/><br/>
            I love solving problems. I love seeing companies grow. I love supporting businesses and the people who run them, because it’s in my DNA.
            <br/><br/>
            Businesses succeed when their infrastructures are secure, scalable and easy to maintain. With GBergeret Cloud Services, my mission is to help you build just that.

            <br/><br/>
            If you’re a tech business, I can support you by integrating myself into your existing engineering team. If you don’t have an engineering team, I’ll manage your cloud infrastructure by acting as one, for as long as you need.

            Every company is different, so I tailor my services to each client. Depending on what you need help with, we can work together on a weekly or monthly basis – but I also provide one-off consulting sessions.
            <br/><br/>
            I’ll offer you the same skills and expertise whatever model you choose, along with out of hours work and 24/7 emergency support.
